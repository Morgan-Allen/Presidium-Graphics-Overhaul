  <content>During the evacuation of Diapsor's capital seven centuries ago, a number of alien artifacts kept as heirlooms of the governing House were stowed on the Imperial flagship, the Spear of Tsedar, for safe transit offworld.  Tragically, the ship broke apart in low orbit, scattering it's crew and cargo, but the flagships' brooding hulk still dominates the landscape.  Perhaps now we can lay claim to these relics of the past?
  
  Retrieve each of 7 alien artifacts.
  Search the wreck of the Spear and ascertain the fate of the governor's family.
  Sensors indicate a heavy latent Artilect presence.  EXTREME CAUTION is advised.
