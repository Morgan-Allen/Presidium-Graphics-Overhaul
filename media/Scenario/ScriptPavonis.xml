  <content>Although this Sector escaped the worst of the fallout during the cataclysm that befell the settled hemisphere, some residual radiation has lingered in what is now a lush wilderness speckled by occasional ruins.  Whether by chance or design, a number of endemic floral species appear to showcase unique medicinal properties.
  
  Obtain and analyse samples of 3 floral species.
  Harvest 20 units of Spyce.
  Our scouts report the presence of territorial predators- be prepared to give these a wide berth.</content>

  <content>To cement your claim on this sector, you will need to meet a minimum Spyce quota of at least 20 units.  Your Ecologists can extract this precious medical resource in tiny amounts from wild vegetation, and in larger quantities from animals they cull- particularly predators.  You will need to site an Ecologist Redoubt for the purpose.</content>
