*  I need the ability to disable shipping entirely until the player is ready.  (GameSettings?  For tips as well?)
*  Minimum of one 'smuggler' ship per settlement.
*  More frequent shipping if you have an airfield.  (N + 1, for each airfield.)
*  Offworld journeys and behaviours.





*  Enemies that come gitcha.  But are significantly weaker than an average agent.  Like vermin.

There's an 8-minute time delay, which is a significant problem for a quick tutorial.  You'll need to schedule faster arrival.  You also need to guarantee a better starting position for the artilects- somewhere far away.


*  Building.
*  Hiring & Migration.
*  Upgrades.
*  Housing & Relocation.
*  Imports & Exports.
*  Taxation & Enforcement.

*  Recon    Missions & Samples.
*  Strike   Missions & Bounties.
*  Security Missions & Claims.
*  Contact  Missions & Pledges.
*  Psy Powers & Direct Leadership.
*  Objectives.

*  The ability to lead missions in person would allow the player to head off on a quick errand, return to the settlement later, and find time-consuming tasks completed.  That could potentially be very attractive.
