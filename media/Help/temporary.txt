*  You need notifications for power/water/atmo and a lack of road connections.

*  Enemies that come gitcha.  But are significantly weaker than an average
   agent.  Like vermin.

There's an 8-minute time delay, which is a significant problem for a quick
tutorial.  You'll need to schedule faster arrival.  You also need to guarantee
a better starting position for the artilects- somewhere far away.


*  Building.
*  Hiring & Migration.
*  Upgrades.
*  Housing & Relocation.
*  Imports & Exports.
*  Taxation & Enforcement.

*  Recon    Missions & Samples.
*  Strike   Missions & Bounties.
*  Security Missions & Claims.
*  Contact  Missions & Pledges.
*  Psy Powers & Direct Leadership.
*  Objectives.

*  The ability to lead missions in person would allow the player to head off on
   a quick errand, return to the settlement later, and find time-consuming tasks
   completed.  That could potentially be very attractive.



TUTORIAL CHANGES
  
  Once the economic structures a built, wait for them to install one or two upgrades.  Then let them proceed, when comfortable, to dealing with enemies.
  
  Introduce a raider against the nearest structure from the far ruins.  Have it
  driven off, then instruct the player in putting up a screened security
  mission.
  
  Introduce a bunch of Kommandos belonging to a different base.  See if you can enlist their aid to find the artilects.  You'll have to use a Contact mission.
  
  With that done, and with the new recruits gained, it's time to finish the job.
  Declare a screened strike mission and destroy them.
  
  By this point, the player should have positive cash flow and at least one
  housing upgrade, to conclude the tutorial on a hopeful note.

  <content>Open your Finances pane (first icon on the top-right), and take a look at your Budgets tab.  This should show a summary of your income and expenses for each day since your arrival.

At this point, you may be running low on funds.  When you're ready, we'll cover some approaches for fixing that.</content>

  <content>There are a number of different ways to establish a strong cash flow, but the best approach depends on your preferences, objectives and local resources.

The topics below will explain the basics for three different approaches.

  <content>If you start out near barren, rocky terrain, Excavation Sites can mine metals and smelt fuel rods, either for export directly or further processing at your Engineer Stations (into parts for sale) and Reactors (into power for local use).

With the right upgrades, your troops can also buy better weapons and armour from your engineers.

Be aware, however- heavy industry pollutes, and most citizens prefer not to live nearby...

  <content>If you have green fingers, you might try establishing an Ecologist Station near fertile, grassy terrain.  This will let you build Nurseries to plant and harvest crops.  (Click-and-drag to cover larger areas.)

Crops are a staple food source, but greens in particular are also a valuable export commodity.  Solar Banks provide power, and Arcologies can beautify your colony.

Ecologist structures take a lot of space, though, which limits your population...

  <content>Your citizens will eventually want somewhere to call home- food in their bellies, and a roof over their heads.  And providing for that can be lucrative.

You can place Seal Tents to designate particular areas as homesteads, while a Stock Exchange will buy and sell goods cheaply to homeowners.  Over time, as goods and services become available, housing will evolve and pay higher taxes.

Housing and merchant structures make nothing by themselves however- they can only boost revenue from other sources.

  <content>Place an Excavation Site somewhere reasonably close by, and ideally in the middle of barren, rocky terrain (surface outcrops indicate the presence of underground minerals, which you can also check on the minimap.)

Once you have a local surplus, remember that you can export metals at your Supply Depot.  (You might also want to install some upgrades to boost production.)

You already have an Engineer Station to produce parts, but there's nothing to stop you building more!</content>

  <content>Alright then.  Open the Commerce tab (under Installations), and place a Stock Exchange and one or two Seal Tents near your Bastion.  Once construction is complete, you should see citizens moving in quickly.</content>
