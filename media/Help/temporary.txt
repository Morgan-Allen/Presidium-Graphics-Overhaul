*  You need notifications for power/water/atmo and a lack of road connections.

*  Enemies that come gitcha.  But are significantly weaker than an average
   agent.  Like vermin.

There's an 8-minute time delay, which is a significant problem for a quick
tutorial.  You'll need to schedule faster arrival.  You also need to guarantee
a better starting position for the artilects- somewhere far away.


*  Building.
*  Hiring & Migration.
*  Upgrades.
*  Housing & Relocation.
*  Imports & Exports.
*  Taxation & Enforcement.

*  Recon    Missions & Samples.
*  Strike   Missions & Bounties.
*  Security Missions & Claims.
*  Contact  Missions & Pledges.
*  Psy Powers & Direct Leadership.
*  Objectives.

*  The ability to lead missions in person would allow the player to head off on
   a quick errand, return to the settlement later, and find time-consuming tasks
   completed.  That could potentially be very attractive.



TUTORIAL CHANGES
  
  Once trade setup is complete, reveal the one nearby.  Invite it's destruction,
  and make sure the player has learned how to set rewards.
  
  Have a raider assault the closest structure to the other ruins.  Zoom to it
  immediately, and make sure it's dead or fled before moving on.
  
  Walk the player through setting a security mission on that structure to
  provide some defence- and using a screened mission to limit applicants.
  
  Walk the player through hiring extra staff.
  
  Then set the objective of conquering the next ruins.  They'll need to both
  explore and strike.
  
  
  The economic objective.  Explain about supply/demand/prices, and how contact
  missions can secure trade partners at an advantageous price.  (Including
  offworld.)
  
  Note that the player is short of funds, and explain how they can use an
  excavation site to obtain more goods for export and reduce expenses.





  Reintroduce these when you can.

  <content>If they haven't done so already, local raiders are likely to begin harassing your settlement, potentially razing structures and harming citizens.

When you're ready, we'll introduce a scouting Drone- a relatively weak robotic enemy, or artilect- to assault your Trooper Lodge.</content>

Remember to offer a reward, or no-one will take up the challenge!</content>

  <content>In order to beef up your security forces, a number of upgrades have been installed at your Trooper Lodge, increasing the barracks space and allowing better skill training.

A number of veteran troopers have also applied to work at the facility, but you don't have space for all of them.  Open the facility's Staff tab- or the Personnel pane- to view their skills and traits.  Then you can decide which to hire.  Fresh recruits should arrive within a day or so.</content>

  <content>That Drone came from an Ancient Ruins somewhere in the darkness of the unexplored regions of the map- and where there's one, others are likely to follow.  Conduct further Recon and Strike Missions to find the ruins and destroy it.

Note:  To tip the odds in your favour, you may wish to hire additional troops.

Note:  You may also wish to make your Missions 'screened' to help control the timing and composition of your assault teams.</content>

  <content>Now that you're familiar with upgrades to housing and other structures, along with the basics of trade and taxation, you'll need to establish a positive cash flow.

Try to increase your current funds by at least 500 credits.

Tip:  You can always get an overview of current expenses and income, along with a summary of demand and prices for various goods, from the Finances pane in the top-right.</content>

  <content>Now that local threats have been dealt with, it's time to focus on building a more prosperous settlement.

Your citizens will need food and housing, so you may wish to establish Holdings where they can settle down.  This can be done from the Installations pane, but your citizens will also establish homes themselves if there's enough pent-up demand- generally 1 Holding for every 4 citizens.

Your citizens can also upgrade their housing once they gain access to the right goods and services.  In addition to improving comfort and morale, this helps to generate tax revenue from sales and savings.  Simply click on a given Holding to see information on what it needs next.

Try to have at least one Holding upgrade to a Pyon Shack.</content>

  <content>Your citizens won't starve immediately, but after several days their rations may start to run low.  Food- such as carbs, greens and protein- can be imported at the Supply Depot as you would any other good.  Plastics are also required for housing development, and can be imported in a similar way.

However, to save on import costs, you may wish to build an Ecologist Station and Nursery to plant and harvest crops, and/or a Fabricator to manufacture plastics.  Your space is limited, however, so choose what to build wisely.</content>
