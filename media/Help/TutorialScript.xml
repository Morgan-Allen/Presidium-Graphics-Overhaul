  <content>Hello, and welcome to Stratos: The Sci-Fi Settlement Sim!  This tutorial will walk you through the essentials of setting up a settlement, exploring the surrounds, dealing with potential threats, and establishing a sound economy.</content>

  <content>First, you'll need to familiarise yourself with basic controls.  Use the W, S, A and D keys to move your viewpoint forward, back, left or right.

(Note:  You can also use the arrow keys, click on the ground, or click a position on the minimap in the top-left.)</content>

  <content>Your settlement starts out with a single main building:  The Bastion, which houses your family and personal servants, and serves as your seat of command for the settlement as a whole.  As such, you should strive to protect the Bastion at all costs.

To do this, you will need to both identify any threats in the area, and take steps to establish defences, which is what we'll cover next.</content>

  <content>To hire troops and other personnel, you'll need to construct facilities to house them.

Open the Installations tab in the top-right of the screen.  Select the Trooper Lodge, click build, and then place one next to your Bastion.</content>

  <content>Good work.  Normally, buildings will take a while to construct and fully staff, but for now we'll speed things up and provide some starting recruits.  If you like, you can click on the new building and take a look at the staff recruited.

Your citizens cannot be directly controlled, but you can hire them to perform missions on your behalf.  Next, we'll engage some of your troops to explore the surrounds of your base.</content>

  <content>Good work.  We'll assign some of your staff to the Recon Mission, but you can adjust the reward offered to attract more applicants.

Your troopers should begin exploring the assigned area shortly.  In the meanwhile, let's take a look at getting a basic economy up and running.</content>

  <content>Excellent.  The technicians at your Bastion should now begin constructing these facilities.  Once that's complete, we'll provide some initial staff and move on to getting some cash flow going.</content>

  <content>Good work.

To improve their production of goods and range of services, many buildings can have upgrades installed.

Select the Engineer Station, open the Upgrades pane, and queue Assembly Line three times.  Your construction staff will attend to it shortly, speeding up Parts manufacture.</content>

  <content>You can also modify the trade settings at your Supply Depot.  Select the Supply Depot, open the Stock pane, and increase your imports of Metals to 10 and exports of Parts to 20.</content>

  <content>That should do it.  It takes a little time for dropships to arrive and perform their transactions- typically once per day.

Once a sale is complete, on-duty auditors from your Bastion will drop by to record and file your profits and losses.  The trick is to make sure you have more of the former.

In the meantime, let's take another look at base security.</content>

  <content>This is an Ancient Ruin close to your base.  Structures such as these often harbour dangerous creatures who may assault your base and waylay colonists- as such, it's a good idea to raze them when found.

Select the Ancient Ruin and declare a Strike Mission (the small red icon underneath.)  Then increase the reward high enough to attract applicants to carry out the job.</content>
