  <content>Hello, and welcome to Stratos: The Sci-Fi Settlement Sim!  This tutorial will walk you through the essentials of setting up a settlement, exploring the surrounds, dealing with potential threats, and establishing a sound economy.</content>

  <content>First, you'll need to familiarise yourself with basic controls.  Use the W, S, A and D keys to move your viewpoint forward, back, left or right.

(Note:  You can also use the arrow keys, click on the ground, or click a position on the minimap in the top-left.)</content>

  <content>Your settlement starts out with a single main building:  The Bastion, which houses your family and personal servants, and serves as your seat of command for the settlement as a whole.  As such, you should strive to protect the Bastion at all costs.

To do this, you will need to both identify any threats in the area, and take steps to establish defences, which is what we'll cover next.</content>

  <content>Good work.  Normally, buildings will take a while to construct and fully staff, but for now we'll speed things up and provide some starting recruits.  If you like, you can click on the new building and take a look at the staff recruited.

The next step would be gain some information about the surrounds of our base.  We need to know what's out there.</content>

  <content>Good work.

To improve their production of goods and range of services, many buildings can have upgrades installed.

Select the Engineer Station, open the Upgrade pane, and queue Assembly Line twice.  Your construction staff will attend to it shortly, speeding up Parts manufacture.  These can then be sold for a profit.</content>

  <content>You can also upgrade your Stock Exchange to make the most of any sales.  Select the Stock Exchange and queue the Rations Vending and Hardware Store upgrades.  This will increase space available to foodstuffs and building materials (e.g, parts), and generate extra profit from any purchases.</content>

  <content>That should do it.  It takes a little time for dropships to arrive and perform their transactions- typically once per day.

Once a sale is complete, on-duty auditors from your Bastion will drop by to record and file your profits and losses.  The trick is to make sure you have more of the former.

In the meantime, let's take another look at base security.</content>

  <content>It looks as though your exploring troops have uncovered an Ancient Ruin close to your base.  Structures such as these often harbour dangerous creatures who may assault your base and waylay colonists- as such, it's a good idea to raze them when found.

Select the Ancient Ruin and declare a Strike Mission (the small red icon underneath.)  Then increase the reward high enough to attract soldiers to carry out the task.</content>

  <content>...Not too encouraging.

There are many ways to earn credits, but on a map like this, with large areas of barren rock and irradiated wasteland, heavy industry turns a faster profit.  Place a second Engineer Station near your first, and an Excavation Site somewhere close to both.

Mining is most efficient near outcrops of surface rock, so keep an eye out for those when exploring.  (You can also check the minimap.)</content>

  <content>While those are building, you may also want to start thinking about giving your citizens a few amenities, such as private housing.  Your colonists will claim lots by themselves given time and space, but you can anticipate that by placing a Seal Tent or two in convenient locations.  Try that now.</content>

  <content>Housing yields tax income, and will upgrade itself as more goods and services become available.

Finally, you may want to supplement your trade income by exporting surplus minerals from your Excavation Site.  Place a Supply Depot to store raw materials and reserve them for trade.</content>

  <content>Good.  We'll wait for any current construction to finish.  All your expenses up to now have been covered for free, but from here on, you'll need to balance your own books.

This might be a good time to see what your Auditors are up to.  Select the Bastion, go the Staff tab, and select one to see if any profits or losses are being filed.</content>

  <content>Auditors will periodically assess profits and losses at nearby venues, tally the sum, and report back to you.  Between imports, upgrades and hiring costs, it might take a day or two for your industry and trade venues to start turning a profit.  You can wait if you wish, or- if you're ready- we'll turn our attentions back to handling external enemies.
