Stratos
===========================

[![Click to see video.](https://github.com/Morgan-Allen/Presidium-Graphics-Overhaul/readme_screen.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auEi5uigmvI)

Stratos (aka Presidium) is a science-fiction themed citybuilder game that borrows equally from Majesty, the Fantasy Kingdom Sim and the Impressions Citybuilder series.

This project is currently in a state of suspended development, and no doubt has some significant bugs.  Hopefully I'll get around to revisiting in future.


## Installation

In principle, you should just be able to download one of the standalone app bundles [here](https://github.com/Morgan-Allen/Presidium-Graphics-Overhaul/releases).  Unzip in the directory of your choice, and double-click to play.

The game comes with a full tutorial that should get you up to speed on the essentials, or you can watch the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auEi5uigmvI).
