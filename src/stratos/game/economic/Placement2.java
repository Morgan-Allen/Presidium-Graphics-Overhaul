  //  Okay.  First rule.  Buildings of major importance (i.e, player-situated),
  //  always have a minimum clearance of 1 from other structures, and access to
  //  a 2x2 thoroughfare.  They also have a minimum 2x2 clearance from aura
  //  structures.
  
  //  Second rule.  Spontaneously-appearing structures follow normal checks for
  //  perimeter clearance, and are planned out entirely during initial placement
  //  of their parent structure.  They should be visible during preview, and
  //  occupy the maximum spread available.
  
  //  Third rule.  2x2 roads with access hatches will be established between
  //  all populated sectors, so long as you have a bastion, with access hatches
  //  for the purpose in each.
