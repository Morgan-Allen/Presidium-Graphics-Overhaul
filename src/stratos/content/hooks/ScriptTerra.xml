  <content>During the evacuation of Diapsor's capital seven centuries ago, a number of alien artifacts kept as heirlooms of the governing House were stowed on the Imperial flagship, the Spear of Tsedar, for safe transit offworld, but tragically the ship was struck down during takeoff and broke apart in low orbit, scattering it's crew and cargo across the skies.  There were no survivors, but the brooding bulk of the flagship's half-buried remains still dominate the landscape.  Whether the ruling family was aboard remains unknown.

Pocked and scoured by nuclear fire, heavy radiation has prevented most prior sorties into this Sector, but perhaps now we can lay claim to these relics of the past.
  
  Retrieve each of 7 alien artifacts.
  Search the wreck of the Spear and ascertain the fate of the governor's family.
  Sensors indicate a heavy latent Artilect presence.  EXTREME CAUTION is advised.
