  <content>Some distant descendants of the Sielig expedition- an imperial survey party sent nearly 2 centuries ago- appear to have not only survived, but intermingled with the native Ybetse tribe.  To legitimate our claim these indigenes will have to either relocated or... persuaded... to ensure access to the land and resources of this territory.  And we must impress them with the comforts of a settled life.
  
  Either drive out all primitives from this territory or secure their allegiance.
  House at least half your settlers in Citizen Apartments or better housing.
  Organised resistance is absent, but individual skirmishes may occur.  Approach with care.
