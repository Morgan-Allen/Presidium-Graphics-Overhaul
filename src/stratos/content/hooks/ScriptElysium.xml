  <content>While passing through this Sector, the renowned Sielig Expedition recounted the presence of numerous, surprisingly inquisitive, primitive tribesmen on either side of the narrow isthmus which separates the polar seas.  Known as the H'Koni, they provided food and porters in exchange for trinkets and pressfeed, and several members of the expedition stayed behind to document their way of life.  It would be 20 standard years before they rejoined Sielig and his men.

Assuming their descendants survive, to legitimate our claim these indigenes will have to either relocated or... persuaded... to ensure access to the land and resources of this territory.

  Either drive out all natives from this territory or secure their fealty.
  Harvest 100 units of Greens and 50 units of Fuel Rods.
  Records give scant indication of organised warfare among the H'Koni, but individual skirmishes are not unlikely.  Approach with care.
