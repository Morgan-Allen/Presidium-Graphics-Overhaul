//
//  This is intended for use by external simulation classes, so that they can
//  maintain a static/constant reference to a graphical resource (i.e, a sprite
//  model) while it's still loading on another thread, and without blocking
//  any main-loop code that refers to the class.
//
//  This should also provide some convenience methods for saving/loading
//  sprites of a given model type, and caching the model in case of multiple
//  references.
