ACTIVE ITEMS:

   Priority:  Medium-High  Duration:  Short?
*  Users should be able to download/run the main game without needing a
   pre-existing Java installation, on OSX, Windows and Linux (i.e, the
   executable should include it's own JVM.)  And that build process should be
   automated.
   
   If you look under the 'resource' folder, there are simple Ant build-scripts
   for OSX and Windows which you could use as a starting point.
   

   Priority:  Very High  Duration:  Long
*  Automated testing needs to be implemented.  I have a lot of Debug<X> classes
   in the src.start directory which set up conditions for testing, but we need
   automatic checking of the results, and the ability to set up batches of
   such scenarios to run in sequence.  This is a big project, so I'd suggest
   starting with something simple (like DebugCombat) and then I can give
   details for filling in the rest.
   
   Ideally, techniquesWereUsedBy should be called during the getCurrentResult
   method for DebugCombat.  (There should also be a separate test-case for
   raidingScenario, with the units in the barracks and the ruins being assigned
   as soldiers for each side.)
   

   Priority:  High  Duration:  Long or Very Long
*  Get rid of all the text-descriptions for the UI and use customised widgets
   instead.  (This will likely require some extra graphics/images for buttons,
   borders, et cetera.)
   
   This is likely to be an elaborate task, but if you take a look at the
   stratos.user.mainscreen.SelectSitePane class and compare it with the
   stratos.user.VenuePane class, then, e.g, describeStaffing in the latter
   should be using a ListingPane to show mini-widgets for each citizen, rather
   than relying on a Text/Description for everything.
   
   You might have to do a little bit of basic UI design for this- show me a
   rough mockup for a given UI component and I can suggest changes or supply
   more detailed art later.
   

   Priority:  Low  Duration:  Short-to-Medium
*  On a similar note, the UI for the sprite-viewer could use some cleanup-
   proper scrolling for lists of parts, nicer borders, et cetera.


   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Medium
*  Implement cel-shading:

   how-can-i-draw-outlines-around-3d-models

   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Short
*  We might consider some kind of alternate-rendering arrangement for indoor
   or obscured actors- like showing a semi-transparent outline.  (This should
   be simple enough once cel-shading is done.)


   Priority:  Low  Duration:  Short-to-Long?
*  .ms3d model loading is extremely slow during startup for some reason.  Check
   to see if switching to a different format would help, or do some profiling
   to see if there are any simple optimisations to apply.  If it looks complex
   to fix, leave for now.

   Priority:  Low  Duration:  Short-to-Long?
*  See if you can either fix the blender importer for .ms3d or get the original
   authors to do so (smoothing groups are not preserved correctly on import.)

DONE OR BLOCKED:

   Priority:  Minor  Duration:  Short?
*  There were reports of minimising the window shutting down the game on
   windows 7 or 8, but can't seem to reproduce.  Will leave for now.

   Priority:  Minor  Duration:  Short?
*  Hats & weapons can be hidden if the costume-texture lacks the right 'fill'
   for their UV.  Not certain how to approach at the moment, will leave for now.
