*  Minimising the window shuts down the game on windows 7 or 8.  Find out why
   and fix.

*  Make sure the sprite-viewer can display the various permutations of human-
   models correctly- costume, skin tone, hairstyles, weapons & armour, etc.
   There are some noticeable glitches at the moment.

*  .ms3d model loading is extremely slow during startup for some reason.  Check
   to see if switching to a different format would help, or if the loading
   routines can be optimised somehow.

*  On my (Morgan's) older Mac there's noticeable slowdown on large maps every 2
   seconds or so, with much of this due to inefficient handling of buffer calls
   on OSX.  Investigate.

*  We might consider some kind of alternate-rendering arrangement for indoor
   or occluded actors- like a semi-transparent overlay if selected.  (Also,
   shield walls/perimeter fence need to have some kind of alternative graphics
   arrangement- consider making them into Mounts, and providing fresh art to
   show windows with sentries inside.)

*  Actors who die off-screen can wind up stuck in their last-seen poses.  Fix
   that.

*  See if you can either fix the blender importer for .ms3d or get the original
   authors to do so (smoothing groups are not preserved correctly on import.)
