BETTER UI INFO/HELP SYSTEM

*  More help on how to get goods for export.  Include a general help-system
  somewhere- from the markets pane, say.  Try to combine 'markets' and
  'budgets' into a single panel (that, or give them two buttons.)
*  Say when the next ship is arriving somewhere- under either the personnel or
   markets pane (or both.)
*  Fix bug with scrolling between different panes.

*  Update help info for all the upgrades!

*  Consider making within-settlement deliveries cost-free?
*  Allow rations-production to satisfy need to eat.

*  Add illustrations to tutorial messages.  (The tutorial in general needs to
   be debugged.)

*  You need to properly explain click-and-drag for zoned/linear structures.
   (Either that, or use default areas.)

*  Try to include the ability to 'ping' areas of the screen for attention, and
   include that as part of the tutorial process.


CLEANING UP THE ECONOMY:

*  A number of structures need bigger footprints, which will require some art
   changes.  Look into that.

*  Try merging the solar bank with the nursery- or the latter with eco station
*  Introduce automatic area-claims.  And make sure the 4 big harvest structures-
   the excavation site, former plant, kommando lodge & eco station- take up
   big plots.
   
*  Estimate output for nurseries, excavations, former plants, solar banks.

*  List total earnings for specific buildings.  Breakdown expenses more finely.
   Restore shortage listing for homelessness.

*  Unavailable structures should be greyed out in the listings.
*  Consider restricting access to some of these structures based on house-
   philosophy or lack of expertise.
   House Procyon- has culture lab, lacks eco station.
   House Altair-  has archives, lacks stock exchange.
   House Taygeta- has runner lodge, lacks enforcer bloc.
   House Suhail-  has kommando lodge, lacks reactor.

*  Allow the former plant to digest carbs, and try to restore dust-crawlers.


TACTICAL AND OUTDOORS

*  Flora is occasionally appearing in paved areas.  Stop that now.

*  Exploring needs a note that it doesn't work at night.

*  Get vermin into the game again!
*  Nocturnal trait.  "They mostly come at night.  Mostly."

*  Try to ensure more concerted mission-behaviours- form up on a single leader
   if possible (alive, high-ranked, first in group.)

*  Ensure raiders will attempt to besiege intervening walls!
*  More vigorous attacks after a few days from artilects, etc.
*  Notifications for casualties and base attacks.

*  There is very noticeable slowdown on large maps every 2 seconds or so.
   Profile and FIND OUT WHY.



BUILDINGS AND ECONOMY-

*  Use service hatches to initiate heavier paving and utility-transmission?

*  Upgrades need to be filled in and tested for:
     Stock Exchange
     Archives
     Runner Market
     Kommando Lodge
     Airfield
     Cut out recruitment-extras for others.
  
  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  There needs to be a more precise 'reservation' system to allow for zoning,
   entrances and not-in-the-world-yet situations.

*  Ensure that spontaneous-buildings can 'migrate' to new sites if conditions
   change.  (Allow that for buildings in general?)

*  Flesh out the full set of behaviours for the major Schools (and the Kommando
   lodge too.)

*  Buildings need to have multiple levels.  (At least for the main/root-guild
   structures.)

*  Integrate spyce-sources and use it to boost Psy abilities (such as sovereign
   spells.)

*  Finalise perimeter fence artwork.


CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR-

*  Actors should be doing more to dispose of bodies.  Burial or recyling.

*  Citizens need to migrate offworld if unhappy/unemployed enough.

*  There needs to be a super-fast system for testing pathability to different
   areas of the map.  (And maybe caching dangers en-route?)

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Rework the migration system to that it's more gradual- colonists arrive from
   the homeworld on a scale of 1-2 months (10-20 days.)  Landing parties 'come
   ashore' every day or two, but those can't respond to job-demand as such.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Proper evaluation of mood and memory-events.

*  General internal clean-up of plan routines.  (Look in PlanUtils.)
    Consider having the actor's agenda contain *only* plans:   Actions and
    Missions can be handled separately.

*  Hide-and-seek needs to be more effective (for retreat, looting and combat.)

*  Figure out entry-permissions for structures and guests, and/or sieges.  (It's
   also possible for long-range pathing to go kaput when it requires going
   through structures that don't permit it, like shield walls for animals.)


CONTROL AND DIRECTION-

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Make Pledges more persistent and nuanced (see Proposal class.)
   Also, try to allow negotiation with buildings, in some sense.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Introduce Call-to-Arms at the Trooper Lodge (with respect to a particular
   mission, or in order to 'man the barricades'.)

*  Psy abilities need to be persistent.

*  Allow psy abilities to be learnt from the Pseer School and other psy
   institutions.  Then, as you use them, you acquire practice that allows
   independant casting independantly (with reduced skill rank.)


ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENT-

*  Try to polish up the Flora- have it look more exotic.

*  Offworld raids by enemy houses!

*  The Yamagur is sufficiently big and powerful that it can't really count as a
   'prey' species (in fact, it tends to wind up pulverising any predators in
   it's territory.)  It needs a tweak to the placement algorithm.

*  Extra concept art for new creatures/vermin:
     Avrodil, Rem Leech, Mistaken, Desert Maw, Hirex Body.

*  Try to adapt standard behaviours (such as FindHome, Repairs, Foraging, etc.
   for use by animals.)  Then get rid of the custom-coding.  And polish up
   vermin behaviours.


INTERFACE AND DEBUGGING

*  Icons could be clearer, at least in the early game.

*  You might need extra tips for no-archives, walls, low funding, homelessness
   and other situations.  Add those in later.

*  Merge BaseCommerce with either the Verse class and/or the BaseAdvice class.

*  Try to implement some global debugging-levels.

*  X and Y coords are reversed on the map, which is sometimes confusing.

*  Include Advisors(?) and more detail Finances/Economy pane.  Charts and
   histograms over time.

*  Include healthbars for psy-meter and target-descriptions?  Personal icon?

*  Try tracking actors only when they wander outside your field of view (or
   start that way.)  And include tracking options in the UI.

*  Need-indicators for structures (water/power/etc. are sometimes lit- up and
   sometimes not, depending on selection & camera position.

*  Read definitions from .xml and allow for later string translations.

*  Try to use right-click for something?  Add an option for it at least.
