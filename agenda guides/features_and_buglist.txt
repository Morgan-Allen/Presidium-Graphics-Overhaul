TO DO NOW-

*  Try to use a fixed roads/walls-template for around the bastion.  That should
   simplify a number of tasks below.


*  If venue-construction begins in an area with a large rock in the middle, it
   appears that foundation-laying may never complete.  Fix that.

*  Citizens with no combat or surveillance skills seem a little too eager to go
   exploring.  (In addition, recon-missions sometimes close prematurely if they
   run into un-pathable tiles.)

*  Try to migrate ephemera/stage.visible (list lower down!)

*  Minimising the window shuts down the game on windows 7 or 8.  Not sure why.

*  For some reason, the current OSX build does not run after download from
   github.  (Replacing stratos.app with the local build's version works fine.)
   In addition, windows-saves do not seem to load.  I probably mixed up the
   build-version at some point- double-check in future.



BUILDINGS AND ECONOMY-

*  Try merging the solar bank with the nursery- or the latter with eco station.

*  Introduce automatic area-claims.  And make sure the 4 big harvest structures-
   the excavation site, former plant, kommando lodge & eco station- take up
   big plots.


*  Upgrades need to be filled in and tested for:
     Stock Exchange
     Archives
     Runner Market
     Kommando Lodge
     Airfield
     Enforcer Bloc
     Cut out recruitment-extras for others.

*  Consider restricting access to some of these structures based on house-
   philosophy or lack of expertise.
   House Procyon- has culture lab, lacks eco station.
   House Altair-  has archives, lacks stock exchange.
   House Taygeta- has runner lodge, lacks enforcer bloc.
   House Suhail-  has kommando lodge, lacks reactor.

*  Buildings need to have multiple levels.  (At least for the main/root-guild
   structures.)  Model these as an upgrade/research-type too.

*  Have upgrades require a 'research' and 'prototype' phase, and include
   notifications for that.  This will slow-down the upgrade process at first,
   but allow for easier transmission of expertise between maps, and ensure that
   initial building-choices don't overwhelm the player.



*  Use service hatches to initiate heavier paving and utility-transmission?

*  Try to restore dust-crawlers at excavation site.

*  Allow rations-production to satisfy need to eat.

*  Apply shipping-cost penalties, so that you can import what you like, but
   can't always export.

*  Ensure that spontaneous-buildings can 'migrate' to new sites if conditions
   change.  (Allow that for buildings in general?)

*  Flesh out the full set of behaviours for the major Schools (and the Kommando
   lodge too.)

*  Integrate spyce-sources and use it to boost Psy abilities (such as sovereign
   spells.)

*  If you ever get fully-3D models in place, you can try block-by-block
   construction/salvage of structures in arbitrary order.  Might not happen for
   a while, though...


THE TUTORIAL

*  And I think I still need to explain security missions.  (And make sure the
   artilects are more proactive as raiders.)

*  Show missions on the minimap, along with proper tool-tips.



CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR-

*  Citizens are too eager to embark on tasks in distant areas.  (BringUtils
   needs to ignore sources that are too far away- that's for bulk transport.)

*  Actors should be doing more to dispose of bodies.  Burial or recyling.

*  There needs to be a super-fast system for testing pathability to different
   areas of the map.  (And maybe caching dangers en-route?)

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Rework the migration system to that it's more gradual- colonists arrive from
   the homeworld on a scale of 1-2 months (10-20 days.)  Landing parties 'come
   ashore' every day or two, but those can't respond to job-demand as such.

*  Citizens need to migrate offworld if unhappy/unemployed enough.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Proper evaluation of mood and memory-events.

*  Consider having the actor's agenda contain *only* plans:   Actions and
   Missions can be handled separately.  (And unify the priority/step evals.)

*  Hide-and-seek needs to be more effective (for retreat, looting and combat.)

*  Figure out entry-permissions for structures and guests, and/or sieges.  (It's
   also possible for long-range pathing to go kaput when it requires going
   through structures that don't permit it, like shield walls for animals.)

*  Vehicles need to be salvaged along with their parent structures.



CONTROL AND DIRECTION-

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Make Pledges more persistent and nuanced (see Proposal class.)
   Also, try to allow negotiation with buildings, in some sense.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Introduce Call-to-Arms at the Trooper Lodge (with respect to a particular
   mission, or in order to 'man the barricades'.)

*  Psy abilities need to be persistent.

*  Allow psy abilities to be learnt from the Pseer School and other psy
   institutions.  Then, as you use them, you acquire practice that allows
   independant casting independantly (with reduced skill rank.)



ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENT-

*  Get vermin into the game again!
*  Nocturnal trait.  "They mostly come at night.  Mostly."

*  Ensure raiders will attempt to besiege intervening walls!
*  More vigorous attacks after a few days from artilects, etc.

*  Try to polish up the Flora- have it look more exotic.

*  Offworld raids by enemy houses!

*  The Yamagur is sufficiently big and powerful that it can't really count as a
   'prey' species (in fact, it tends to wind up pulverising any predators in
   it's territory.)  It needs a tweak to the placement algorithm.

*  Extra concept art for new creatures/vermin:
     Avrodil, Rem Leech, Mistaken, Desert Maw, Hirex Body.

*  Try to adapt standard behaviours (such as FindHome, Repairs, Foraging, etc.
   for use by animals.)  Then get rid of the custom-coding.  And polish up
   vermin behaviours.


*  I think I'm seeing some noticeable hiccups during pathing by a single drone.
   The slowdown must be in those path-routines.

*  There is very noticeable slowdown on large maps every 2 seconds or so.
   Profile and FIND OUT WHY.
   TODO:  Consider using jHiccup for this:

INTERFACE AND DEBUGGING

*  You need to report output for *all* items produced at the engineer station,
   fabricator, physician station, etc..

*  Notifications for casualties and base attacks.

*  List total earnings for specific buildings.  Breakdown expenses more finely.
   Restore shortage listing for homelessness.

*  Icons could be clearer, at least in the early game.

*  You might need extra tips for no-archives, walls, low funding, homelessness
   and other situations.  Add those in later.


*  All the methods for venue-placement and siting within PlaceUtils and the
   PlacingTask class need to be reviewed and possibly merged into a single set
   of methods.  Siting should be used for Dropships' land-areas as well.

*  Merge BaseCommerce with either the Verse class and/or the BaseAdvice class.

*  Re-introduce the Planets/Sectors pane, and build the markets-report into
   that for each world.  Then finance can stay on it's own.  (Add little
   portraits for each world in the partners-listing too.  Use current art!)


*  Try to implement some global debugging-levels.

*  X and Y coords are reversed on the map, which is sometimes confusing.

*  Include Advisors(?) and more detail Finances/Economy pane.  Charts and
   histograms over time.

*  Include healthbars for psy-meter and target-descriptions?  Personal icon?

*  Try tracking actors only when they wander outside your field of view (or
   start that way.)  And include tracking options in the UI.

*  Need-indicators for structures (water/power/etc. are sometimes lit- up and
   sometimes not, depending on selection & camera position.

*  Read definitions from .xml and allow for later string translations.

*  Try to use right-click for something?  Add an option for it at least.



ART, GRAPHICS AND MEDIA PRODUCTION

*  A number of structures need bigger footprints, which will require some art
   changes.  Look into that.

*  You might consider some kind of alternate-rendering arrangement for indoor
   or occluded actors- like a semi-transparent overlay if selected.  (Also,
   shield walls/perimeter fence need to have some kind of alternative graphics
   arrangement- consider making them into Mounts, and providing fresh art to
   show windows with sentries inside.)

*  Finalise perimeter fence artwork.

*  Actors who die off-screen can wind up stuck in their last-seen poses.  Fix
   that.

*  Ensure that .ms3d models loaded without skins show a default material.  (At
   the moment they don't.)

*  .ms3d model loading is extremely slow for some reason.

*  Attempt using blender again.
