TO DO NOW-

*  Try to use a fixed roads/walls-template for within the bastion.  That should
   simplify a number of tasks below.  (You also need to space out the entrances
   less frequently.)

*  By default, venues should select entrances that are already designated for
   paving (in a 2x2 area.)  This should reduce clutter.  (Better yet, you could
   have venues switch their entrances if possible on blockage.)

*  Introduce automatic area-claims.  And make sure the 4 big harvest structures-
   the excavation site, chemical pan, xeno lodge & eco station- take up
   big plots.  (These need to be visible during user-placement too.)


*  Install AUTO-TURRETS at your sentry-posts & blast doors.  (Simple motion-
   detectors if you don't have a pass-code.)  Plus combat stims at stock-
   exchange & physician station.

*  Ensure that mining still works after all these changes.  (Smelters?)
*  Try merging the solar bank with the nursery- or the latter with eco station.


*  Try to migrate ephemera/stage.visible (list lower down!)

*  Item-stocks rendering at the stock-exchange and supply depot needs to be
   restored.


SPECIFIC TO FARMS & MINES-

* Excavation sites:  tailings, openings, mantle drills, strip mining
  Strip mining is the first step.
  No multi smelters- everything gets processed at the central shaft.
  Mantle drills will only be built on fully stripped terrain (i.e- full
    barrens, minus all biomass, topsoil and surface minerals.)
  Tailings never disappear (unless reprocessed.)
  
* Chemical pans appear more frequently in desert/caustic terrain.  They produce
    reagents & spyce from the atmosphere or local deposits.

* Moisture farms:    cropland, hives, covered tunnels, aquaculture + solar banks
  Seedlings grow at the central nursery.
  Cropland & hives appear with the right upgrades.
  Covered tunnels & underground-sections increase growth once you add plastics,
    and are preferred in deserts.
  Aquaculture will appear if placed over water, giving extra greens & protein.
  
* Solar banks appear more frequently in dryer/sunnier terrain.  They produce
    water & power, with more of the former when extended over water.


* Can we assume, for now, that these are all 4x4 or 2x4 structures, with
    facings/entrances in the appropriate direction?
  
  strip-mines -> mantle drills
  tailings (general slag, ore ponds, isotope casings.)
  chemical pans
  
  tunnels & aquaculture
  nurseries & moisture farms
  solar banks & condensors


BUILDINGS AND ECONOMY-

*  Upgrades need to be filled in and tested for:
     Stock Exchange
     Archives
     Runner Market
     Kommando Lodge
     Airfield
     Enforcer Bloc
     Cut out recruitment-extras for others.

*  Consider restricting access to some of these structures based on house-
   philosophy or lack of expertise.
   House Procyon- has culture lab, lacks eco station.
   House Altair-  has archives, lacks stock exchange.
   House Taygeta- has runner lodge, lacks enforcer bloc.
   House Suhail-  has kommando lodge, lacks reactor.

*  Have upgrades require a 'research' and 'prototype' phase, and include
   notifications for that.  This will slow-down the upgrade process at first,
   but allow for easier transmission of expertise between maps, and ensure that
   initial building-choices don't overwhelm the player.

*  Buildings need to have multiple levels.  (At least for the main/root-guild
   structures.)  Model these as an upgrade/research-type too.

*  Limit service-hatches to along road-routes between structures (and required
   to activate power-transmission in an area.)


*  Try to restore dust-crawlers at excavation site.

*  Allow rations-production to satisfy need to eat.

*  Apply shipping-cost penalties, so that you can import what you like, but
   can't always viably export.

*  Ensure that spontaneous-buildings can 'migrate' to new sites if conditions
   change.  (Allow that for buildings in general if desired.)

*  Flesh out the full set of behaviours for the major Schools (and the Kommando
   lodge too.)

*  Integrate spyce-sources and use it to boost Psy abilities (such as sovereign
   spells.)

*  Wood is valued for aesthetic properties (decor at the fabricator), along
   with trophies/curios for outfits.



THE TUTORIAL

*  And I think I still need to explain security missions.  (And make sure the
   artilects are more proactive as raiders.)

*  Show missions on the minimap, along with proper tool-tips.



CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR-

*  Citizens are too eager to embark on tasks in distant areas.  (BringUtils
   needs to ignore sources that are too far away- that's for bulk transport.)

*  Actors should be doing more to dispose of bodies.  Burial or recyling.

*  There needs to be a super-fast system for testing pathability to different
   areas of the map.  (And maybe caching dangers en-route?)

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Rework the migration system to that it's more gradual- colonists arrive from
   the homeworld on a scale of 1-2 months (10-20 days.)  Landing parties 'come
   ashore' every day or two, but those can't respond to job-demand as such.

*  Citizens need to migrate offworld if unhappy/unemployed enough.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Proper evaluation of mood and memory-events.

*  Consider having the actor's agenda contain *only* plans:   Actions and
   Missions can be handled separately.  (And unify the priority/step evals.)

*  Hide-and-seek needs to be more effective (for retreat, looting and combat.)

*  Figure out entry-permissions for structures and guests, and/or sieges.  (It's
   also possible for long-range pathing to go kaput when it requires going
   through structures that don't permit it, like shield walls for animals.)

*  Vehicles need to be salvaged along with their parent structures.



CONTROL AND DIRECTION-

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Make Pledges more persistent and nuanced (see Proposal class.)
   Also, try to allow negotiation with buildings, in some sense.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Introduce Call-to-Arms at the Trooper Lodge (with respect to a particular
   mission, or in order to 'man the barricades'.)

*  Psy abilities need to be persistent.

*  Allow psy abilities to be learnt from the Pseer School and other psy
   institutions (plus Kommando Redoubt.)  Then, as you use them, you acquire
   practice that allows casting independantly (with reduced skill rank.)



ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENT-

*  Get vermin into the game again!
*  Nocturnal trait.  "They mostly come at night.  Mostly."

*  Ensure raiders will attempt to besiege intervening walls!
*  More vigorous attacks after a few days from artilects, etc.

*  Try to polish up the Flora- have it look more exotic.

*  Offworld raids by enemy houses!

*  The Yamagur is sufficiently big and powerful that it can't really count as a
   'prey' species (in fact, it tends to wind up pulverising any predators in
   it's territory.)  It needs a tweak to the placement algorithm.

*  Extra concept art for new creatures/vermin:
     Avrodil, Rem Leech, Mistaken, Desert Maw, Hirex Body.

*  Try to adapt standard behaviours (such as FindHome, Repairs, Foraging, etc.
   for use by animals.)  Then get rid of the custom-coding.  And polish up
   vermin behaviours.

*  I think I'm seeing some noticeable hiccups during pathing by a single drone.
   The slowdown must be in those path-routines.



INTERFACE AND DEBUGGING

*  You need to report output for *all* items produced at the engineer station,
   fabricator, physician station, etc..

*  Notifications for casualties and base attacks.

*  List total earnings for specific buildings.  Breakdown expenses more finely.
   Restore shortage listing for homelessness.

*  You might need extra tips for no-archives, walls, low funding, homelessness
   and other situations.  Add those in later.


*  Merge BaseCommerce with either the Verse class and/or the BaseAdvice class.

*  Re-introduce the Planets/Sectors pane, and build the markets-report into
   that for each world.  Then finance can stay on it's own.  (Add little
   portraits for each world in the partners-listing too.  Use current art!)


*  Try to implement some global debugging-levels.

*  X and Y coords are reversed on the map, which is sometimes confusing.

*  Include Advisors(?) and more detail Finances/Economy pane.  Charts and
   histograms over time.

*  Include healthbars for psy-meter and target-descriptions?  Personal icon?

*  Try tracking actors only when they wander outside your field of view (or
   start that way.)  And include tracking options in the UI.

*  Need-indicators for structures (water/power/etc. are sometimes lit- up and
   sometimes not, depending on selection & camera position.

*  Read definitions from .xml and allow for later string translations.

*  Try to use right-click for something?  Add an option for it at least.



ART, GRAPHICS AND MEDIA PRODUCTION

*  Icons could be clearer, at least in the early game.

*  A number of structures need bigger footprints, which will require some art
   changes.  Look into that.

*  You might consider some kind of alternate-rendering arrangement for indoor
   or occluded actors- like a semi-transparent overlay if selected.  (Also,
   shield walls/perimeter fence need to have some kind of alternative graphics
   arrangement- consider making them into Mounts, and providing fresh art to
   show windows with sentries inside.)

*  Finalise perimeter fence artwork.

*  Actors who die off-screen can wind up stuck in their last-seen poses.  Fix
   that.

*  Attempt using blender again.
   http://waldobronchart.github.io/ShortcutMapper/#Blender
   Emulate numeric pad in User Preferences/Input and by checking Emulate Numpad

*  See if you can either fix the blender importer for .ms3d or get the original
   authors to do so (smoothing groups are not preserved correctly on import.)
   http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/
          Py/Scripts/Import-Export/MilkShape3D_MS3D
   http://git.blender.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi/blender-addons.git/
          tree/HEAD:/io_scene_ms3d/

*  If you ever get fully-3D models in place, you can try block-by-block
   construction/salvage of structures in arbitrary order.  Might not happen for
   a while, though...
