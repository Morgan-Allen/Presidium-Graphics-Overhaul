  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Rework the migration system to that it's more gradual- colonists arrive from
   the homeworld on a scale of 1-2 months (10-20 days.)  Landing parties 'come
   ashore' every day or two, but those can't respond to job-demand as such.

*  Citizens need to migrate offworld if unhappy/unemployed enough.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Proper evaluation of mood and memory-events.
   
   Allow both hiring and queueing of upgrades before a structure is complete,
   and allow relocating once it is.

*  Features to add:
   Auto-Turret behaviour.  Forcefield generation.
   Building-stealth.       Platform gunner.





*  I may need to implement a major change where each Base is responsible for
   managing structures/settlements both within and outside the world (thereby
   corresponding to a faction) and things like sectors/planets implement the
   Boarding interface.  It's the only safe, consistent way to implement pathing
   attempts and ensure base-membership.


*  The Airfield should be responsible for imposing offworld supply/demand at a
   local level.
   
*  Animals & children need to be looked after as part of general Supervision-
   behaviour.  (In fact, you need a general interface for this, with animal-
   tending as some method overrides for the eco station.)
   
*  Mount behaviours are working, but could use some polish.  You need to have a
   better definition for the kinds of tasks that merit being mounted, and make
   sure that mounts are prompter about responding.  (A MountUtils class may
   be in order for cleanup.)


*  Ensure that political-relations fx for house suhail and full trait/skill fx
   for gender are working when you begin a new game.  (Also, consider allowing
   'upstart' or 'diplomatic' as backgrounds.)

*  Add random tips during the loading-screens.



*  General tweaks-
   
   Stock Exchange:  Handles anything considered a finished good (including
   second-stage items like plastics, parts or foodstuffs.)  Allows upgrades.
   
   Make sure housing has adequate aesthetics.

*  SFX might not belong with attacks called by a technique.
   Create a Volley class for combat, that techniques can then modify in an
   'organic' manner.  (Skills might need something similar.)


*  Limit everything to level 2 at most for the moment (1 less than max.)
     That should be enough for demo purposes.

   Make sure upgrades and abilities are functioning for each of these.
   (And double-check correct knowledge-setup for the various houses.)

*  Make sure that the NestUtils calls for fauna-population get translated back
   into a SitingPass- and ensure that fauna can build their own nests again.


ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENT-

*  Try to polish up the Flora- have it look more exotic.

*  Extra concept art for new creatures/vermin:
     Rem Leech, Mistaken, Desert Maw, Hirex Body.

*  Try to adapt standard behaviours (such as FindHome, Repairs, Foraging, etc.
   for use by animals.)  Then get rid of the custom-coding.



BUILDINGS AND ECONOMY-

*  Limit service-hatches to along road-routes between structures (and required
   to activate power-transmission in an area.)

*  Allow rations-production to satisfy need to eat.

*  Apply shipping-cost penalties, so that you can import what you like, but
   can't always viably export.

*  Ensure that spontaneous-buildings can 'migrate' to new sites if conditions
   change.  (Allow that for buildings in general if desired.)

*  Flesh out the full set of behaviours for the major Schools (and the Kommando
   lodge too.)

*  Integrate spyce-sources and use it to boost Psy abilities (such as sovereign
   spells.)

*  Implement long-distance auto-paving, but only for autonomous base-AI.  The
   player can handle most connections themselves.



SPECIFIC TO RESOURCE-HARVESTING-

*  Excavation sites:
  Could use a new terrain-type for strip mining, and/or art to show shafts
  being sunk for mantle drills.
  Output-estimation could be a little more averaged.


THE TUTORIAL

*  I think I still need to explain security missions.

*  Show missions on the minimap, along with proper tool-tips.



CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR-

*  Some runner abilities need undercover ops to be implemented.

*  Have actors generate emergency behaviours in a separate routine from
   'regular' behaviours?  Have them trumped there?

//  Spare Time:   Studying.  R&R.  Talking.  Exploring.
//  Work:         Commerce.  Manufacture.  Resources.
//                Performance.  Medicine.  Audits.
//  Emergencies:  Fighting.  Defending.  Fleeing.  Pleas.

*  Citizens are too eager to embark on tasks in distant areas.  (BringUtils
   needs to ignore sources that are too far away- that's for bulk transport.)

*  Consider having the actor's agenda contain *only* plans:   Actions and
   Missions can be handled separately.  (And unify the priority/step evals.)

*  Hide-and-seek needs to be more effective (for retreat, looting and combat.)

*  Figure out entry-permissions for structures and guests- especially walls.
   Also, consider adding danger/FoW-evaluation to pathfinding?

*  Vehicles need to be salvaged along with their parent structures.



CONTROL AND DIRECTION-

*  Restore fast-forward and slow-motion options (possibly as psy fx.)

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Make Pledges more persistent and nuanced (see Proposal class.)
   Also, try to allow negotiation with buildings, in some sense.

*  Psy abilities need to be persistent.

*  Allow psy abilities to be learnt from the Pseer School and other psy
   institutions (plus Kommando Redoubt.)  Then, as you use them, you acquire
   practice that allows casting independantly (with reduced skill rank.)



INTERFACE AND DEBUGGING

*  You might need extra tips for no-archives, walls, low funding, homelessness
   and other situations.  Add those in later.

*  Merge BaseCommerce with either the Verse class and/or the BaseAdvice class.

*  Try to implement some global debugging-levels.

*  X and Y coords are reversed on the map, which is sometimes confusing.

*  Include Advisors(?) and more detail Finances/Economy pane.  Charts and
   histograms over time.

*  Include healthbars for psy-meter and target-descriptions?  Personal icon?

*  Try tracking actors only when they wander outside your field of view (or
   start that way.)  And include tracking options in the UI.

*  Need-indicators for structures (water/power/etc. are sometimes lit- up and
   sometimes not, depending on selection & camera position.

*  Read definitions from .xml and allow for later string translations.

*  Try to use right-click for something?  Add an option for it at least.

   Priority:  Minor  Duration:  Moment
*  Rename 'SectorBase' to 'Colony'?



ART, GRAPHICS AND MEDIA PRODUCTION

*  Actors who die off-screen can wind up stuck in their last-seen poses.  Fix
   that.

*  Add options to show/hide speech-bubbles and other bits of citizen info.

*  On my (Morgan's) older Mac there's noticeable slowdown on large maps every 2
   seconds or so, with much of this due to inefficient handling of buffer calls
   on OSX.  Investigate.

*  We might consider some kind of alternate-rendering arrangement for indoor
   or occluded actors- like a semi-transparent overlay if selected.  (Also,
   shield walls/perimeter fence need to have some kind of alternative graphics
   arrangement- consider making them into Mounts, and providing fresh art to
   show windows with sentries inside.)

*  Try to migrate ephemera/stage.visible (list lower down!)

*  Item-stocks rendering at the stock-exchange and supply depot needs to be
   restored.

*  Icons could be clearer, at least in the early game.

*  A number of structures need bigger footprints, which will require some art
   changes.  Look into that.

*  Finalise perimeter fence artwork.

*  Attempt using blender again.
   http://waldobronchart.github.io/ShortcutMapper/#Blender
   Emulate numeric pad in User Preferences/Input and by checking Emulate Numpad

*  If you ever get fully-3D models in place, you can try block-by-block
   construction/salvage of structures in arbitrary order.  Might not happen for
   a while, though...
