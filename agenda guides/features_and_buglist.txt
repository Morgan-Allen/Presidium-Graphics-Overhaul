TESTER FEEDBACK AND TUTORIAL TODO LIST:

*  Try to update the shortage-notifications to reflect the various stages of
   delivery.

*  More feedback on needs and settlement demands.  (Notifications or an RCI
   indicator of some sort are needed.)  You need feedback for-
     *  Citizen needs   / no food source (imports or grown.)
     *  Low funding     / no income source (exports or taxes.)
     *  Citizen housing / no holdings built.
     *  Specific goods  / no factory source built.
     *  Citizen health  / no medical team (sickbay and archives.)
     *  Danger          / no security force (walls and military.)
   Emphasise the emotive component here?

*  ADD IMAGE-TIPS FOR THE TUTORIAL-MESSAGES.

*  Drag buildings from the install-pane directly onto the ground!  That's what
   he was talking about.  You could also make use of right-click for something.

*  Try to polish up the Flora- have it look more exotic.

*  Icons could be clearer, at least in the early game.

*  Finalise perimeter fence artwork.

*  There is still a strange bug in auto-paving that can cause actors to try and
   pave tiled underneath venues.  (Also, they don't always delete correctly.)
   Find out why...

*  Nobody seems to visit the Cantina!  Boo!


BUILDINGS AND ECONOMY-
   
  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  There needs to be a more precise 'reservation' system to allow for zoning,
   entrances and not-in-the-world-yet situations.

*  Ensure that spontaneous-buildings can 'migrate' to new sites if conditions
   change.  (Allow that for buildings in general?)

*  Upgrades need to be filled in and tested for:
     Stock Exchange
     Archives
     Runner Market
     Kommando Lodge
     Airfield
     Cut out recruitment-extras for others.

*  Use service hatches to initiate heavier paving and utility-transmission?
   Arcologies might have auto-placement?

*  Flesh out the full set of behaviours for the major Schools (and the Kommando
   lodge too.)

*  Buildings need to have multiple levels.  (At least for the main/root-guild
   structures.)

*  Integrate spyce-sources and use it to boost Psy abilities (such as sovereign
   spells.)

*  There are occasional inconsistencies in the paving network (routes being
   valid on turn, then invalid the next.)  Rare, but keep an eye out.


CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR-

*  Actors should be doing more to dispose of bodies.  Burial or recyling.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Rework the migration system to that it's more gradual- colonists arrive from
   the homeworld on a scale of 1-2 months (10-20 days.)  Landing parties 'come
   ashore' every day or two, but those can't respond to job-demand as such.

*  Citizens need to migrate offworld if unhappy/unemployed enough.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Proper evaluation of mood and memory-events.

*  General internal clean-up of plan routines.  (Look in PlanUtils.)
    Consider having the actor's agenda contain *only* plans:   Actions and
    Missions can be handled separately.

*  Hide-and-seek needs to be more effective (for retreat, looting and combat.)

*  Figure out entry-permissions for structures and guests, and/or sieges.  (It's
   also possible for long-range pathing to go kaput when it requires going
   through structures that don't permit it, like shield walls for animals.)


CONTROL AND DIRECTION-

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Make Pledges more persistent and nuanced (see Proposal class.)
   Also, try to allow negotiation with buildings, in some sense.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Introduce Call-to-Arms at the Trooper Lodge (with respect to a particular
   mission, or in order to 'man the barricades'.)

*  Psy abilities need to be persistent.

*  Allow psy abilities to be learnt from the Pseer School and other psy
   institutions.  Then, as you use them, you acquire practice that allows
   independant casting independantly (with reduced skill rank.)


ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENT-

*  There needs to be a super-fast system for testing pathability to different
   areas of the map.  (And maybe caching dangers en-route?)

*  Offworld raids by enemy houses!

*  The Yamagur is sufficiently big and powerful that it can't really count as a
   'prey' species (in fact, it tends to wind up pulverising any predators in
   it's territory.)  It needs a tweak to the placement algorithm.

*  Extra concept art for new creatures/vermin:
     Avrodil, Rem Leech, Mistaken, Desert Maw, Hirex Body.

*  Try to adapt standard behaviours (such as FindHome, Repairs, Foraging, etc.
   for use by animals.)  Then get rid of the custom-coding.  And polish up
   vermin behaviours.


INTERFACE AND DEBUGGING

*  Try to implement some global debugging-levels.

*  X and Y coords are reversed on the map, which is sometimes confusing.

*  Include Advisors(?) and more detail Finances/Economy pane.  Charts and
   histograms over time.

*  Include healthbars for psy-meter and target-descriptions?  Personal icon?

*  Try tracking actors only when they wander outside your field of view (or
   start that way.)  And include tracking options in the UI.

*  Need-indicators for structures (water/power/etc. are sometimes lit- up and
   sometimes not, depending on selection & camera position.

*  Read definitions from .xml and allow for later string translations.
