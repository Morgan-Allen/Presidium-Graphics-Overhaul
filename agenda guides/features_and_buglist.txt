TO DO NOW-

*  Make sure the pathing-cache works for fast calculation of zone-reachability!
   (Later, you can piggy-back the paving-system off this data.)

*  Ensure raiders will attempt to besiege intervening walls.
*  More vigorous attacks after a few days from artilects, etc.
   
   Cranials.  Get them working!


*  Hook up, and test, the common abilities.  (Plus general learning & use of
   the others.)

*  See if you can hook up ammo clips and power cells.
*  Psy inhibition needs to be filled in?
*  Noble command and call of duty
*  Some runner abilities need undercover ops to be implemented.


*  Offworld raids by enemy houses!


*  Give vermin... one or two special abilities.  Like, night vision and
   plague, plus a bite/behead ability.
   Lictovores get Maul.
   Yamagur get stun/slam.

*  Add some artilect abilities.
   Cran & Tri- impale, high beam, silver plague, reflection shockwave, plus
   detonate and slough for Drone & Cybrid.




*  Initial missions:
    Planitia Sector (robots + ruins, artifact.)
    Pavonis Sector (mild settlement, pacified.)
    Aeolis Sector (desert plus wildlife.)
    Marineris Sector (neutral + water/islands.  Some wildlife.)



*  General tweaks-
   
   Supply Depot:  Handles anything used as raw materials (including second
   -stage items like plastics, parts or foodstuffs.)  Allows direct control.
   
   Stock Exchange:  Handles anything considered a finished good (including
   second-stage items like plastics, parts or foodstuffs.)  Allows upgrades.
   
   Resource-sites need to have a more flexible zoning-policy (so they can fit
   inside the walls if need be.)
   
   Make sure housing has adequate aesthetics.


*  Provide notifications for deaths and arrivals.

*  Allow free trading by dropships sans trade facilities.

*  Extra Trooper abilities-
  
  Call of Duty  (can assign to several missions directly.)
  Noble Command (creates a commander position with several perks.)
  
  SFX might not belong with attacks called by a technique.
  Create a Volley class for combat, that techniques can then modify in an
  'organic' manner.


*  Limit everything to level 2 at most for the moment (1 less than max.)
     That should be enough for demo purposes.

   Make sure upgrades and abilities are functioning for each of these.
   (And double-check correct knowledge-setup for the various houses.)

*  Features to add:
   Auto-Turret behaviour.  Forcefield generation.
   Combat Stims.     Physician abilities.
   T-Null Armbands.  Engineer abilities.
   Lictor Riding.    Building-stealth.

*  Make sure that the NestUtils calls for fauna-population get translated back
   into a SitingPass- and ensure that fauna can build their own nests again.

*  Trees need more elegant spacing.


ENEMIES AND ENVIRONMENT-

*  Nocturnal trait.  "They mostly come at night.  Mostly."

*  Try to polish up the Flora- have it look more exotic.

*  The Yamagur is sufficiently big and powerful that it can't really count as a
   'prey' species (in fact, it tends to wind up pulverising any predators in
   it's territory.)  It needs a tweak to the placement algorithm.

*  Extra concept art for new creatures/vermin:
     Rem Leech, Mistaken, Desert Maw, Hirex Body.

*  Try to adapt standard behaviours (such as FindHome, Repairs, Foraging, etc.
   for use by animals.)  Then get rid of the custom-coding.  And polish up
   vermin behaviours.

*  I think I'm seeing some noticeable hiccups during pathing by a single drone.
   The slowdown must be in those path-routines.


BUILDINGS AND ECONOMY-

*  Limit service-hatches to along road-routes between structures (and required
   to activate power-transmission in an area.)

*  Try to restore dust-crawlers at chem panner and/or excavation site.

*  Allow rations-production to satisfy need to eat.

*  Apply shipping-cost penalties, so that you can import what you like, but
   can't always viably export.

*  Ensure that spontaneous-buildings can 'migrate' to new sites if conditions
   change.  (Allow that for buildings in general if desired.)

*  Flesh out the full set of behaviours for the major Schools (and the Kommando
   lodge too.)

*  Integrate spyce-sources and use it to boost Psy abilities (such as sovereign
   spells.)

*  Wood is valued for aesthetic properties (decor at the fabricator), along
   with fossils/curios for outfits.


*  Implement long-distance auto-paving, but only for autonomous base-AI.  The
   player can handle most connections themselves.



SPECIFIC TO RESOURCE-HARVESTING-

*  Excavation sites:
  Could use a new terrain-type for strip mining, and/or art to show shafts
  being sunk for mantle drills.
  Implement mining of surface rocks.
  Extra tailings for polymer.
  Output-estimation could be a little more averaged.
  
* Chemical pans appear more frequently in desert/caustic terrain.  They produce
    reagents & spyce from the atmosphere or local deposits.

*  Moisture farms:
  Could be called that.
  Could use art & code for aquaculture & desalinators.
  
* Solar banks appear more frequently in dryer/sunnier terrain.  They produce
    water & power, with more of the former when extended over water.

*  Step-by-step demolition of large rocks (or other fixtures) as a prelude to
   site-construction, paving, mining, et cetera.  Similar work-flow.


THE TUTORIAL

*  And I think I still need to explain security missions.  (And make sure the
   artilects are more proactive as raiders.)

*  Show missions on the minimap, along with proper tool-tips.



CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR-


//  Spare Time:   Studying.  R&R.  Talking.  Exploring.
//  Work:         Commerce.  Manufacture.  Resources.
//                Performance.  Medicine.  Audits.
//  Emergencies:  Fighting.  Defending.  Fleeing.  Pleas.

*  Citizens are too eager to embark on tasks in distant areas.  (BringUtils
   needs to ignore sources that are too far away- that's for bulk transport.)

*  Actors should be doing more to dispose of bodies.  Burial or recyling.

*  There needs to be a super-fast system for testing pathability to different
   areas of the map.  (And maybe caching dangers en-route?)

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Rework the migration system to that it's more gradual- colonists arrive from
   the homeworld on a scale of 1-2 months (10-20 days.)  Landing parties 'come
   ashore' every day or two, but those can't respond to job-demand as such.

*  Citizens need to migrate offworld if unhappy/unemployed enough.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Proper evaluation of mood and memory-events.

*  Consider having the actor's agenda contain *only* plans:   Actions and
   Missions can be handled separately.  (And unify the priority/step evals.)

*  Hide-and-seek needs to be more effective (for retreat, looting and combat.)

*  Figure out entry-permissions for structures and guests, and/or sieges.  (It's
   also possible for long-range pathing to go kaput when it requires going
   through structures that don't permit it, like shield walls for animals.)

*  Vehicles need to be salvaged along with their parent structures.



CONTROL AND DIRECTION-

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Make Pledges more persistent and nuanced (see Proposal class.)
   Also, try to allow negotiation with buildings, in some sense.

  >>>>>>> DO THIS <<<<<<<
*  Introduce Call-to-Arms at the Trooper Lodge (with respect to a particular
   mission, or in order to 'man the barricades'.)

*  Psy abilities need to be persistent.

*  Allow psy abilities to be learnt from the Pseer School and other psy
   institutions (plus Kommando Redoubt.)  Then, as you use them, you acquire
   practice that allows casting independantly (with reduced skill rank.)



INTERFACE AND DEBUGGING

*  You need to report output for *all* items produced at the engineer station,
   fabricator, physician station, etc..

*  Notifications for casualties and base attacks.

*  List total earnings for specific buildings.  Breakdown expenses more finely.
   Restore shortage listing for homelessness.

*  You might need extra tips for no-archives, walls, low funding, homelessness
   and other situations.  Add those in later.


*  Merge BaseCommerce with either the Verse class and/or the BaseAdvice class.

*  Re-introduce the Planets/Sectors pane, and build the markets-report into
   that for each world.  Then finance can stay on it's own.  (Add little
   portraits for each world in the partners-listing too.  Use current art!)


*  Try to implement some global debugging-levels.

*  X and Y coords are reversed on the map, which is sometimes confusing.

*  Include Advisors(?) and more detail Finances/Economy pane.  Charts and
   histograms over time.

*  Include healthbars for psy-meter and target-descriptions?  Personal icon?

*  Try tracking actors only when they wander outside your field of view (or
   start that way.)  And include tracking options in the UI.

*  Need-indicators for structures (water/power/etc. are sometimes lit- up and
   sometimes not, depending on selection & camera position.

*  Read definitions from .xml and allow for later string translations.

*  Try to use right-click for something?  Add an option for it at least.



ART, GRAPHICS AND MEDIA PRODUCTION

*  Try to migrate ephemera/stage.visible (list lower down!)

*  Item-stocks rendering at the stock-exchange and supply depot needs to be
   restored.

*  Icons could be clearer, at least in the early game.

*  A number of structures need bigger footprints, which will require some art
   changes.  Look into that.

*  Finalise perimeter fence artwork.

*  Attempt using blender again.
   http://waldobronchart.github.io/ShortcutMapper/#Blender
   Emulate numeric pad in User Preferences/Input and by checking Emulate Numpad

*  If you ever get fully-3D models in place, you can try block-by-block
   construction/salvage of structures in arbitrary order.  Might not happen for
   a while, though...
