What are the tradeoffs involved in this game?
  The packing problem of placement of services and infrastructure while
  accomodating housing and estates.
  The personnel you choose to recruit, their personalities, and which missions
  you send them on at what times.
  The schools you invest in and large-scale politics, which become an
  increasingly binding commitment.
