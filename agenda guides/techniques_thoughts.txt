  I want 3-4 techniques per class, for 18 classes (7 stations, 7 schools, 3
  species, and the nobility.  Some get more, some less.)
  I have those worked out for the schools, and working out some for alien
  species should be easy-ish.

  So now I need 3-4 each for the other 'mundane' classes:
    Trooper
    Enforcer
    Runner
    Kommando
    Artificer
    Physician
    Ecologist
    Noble
  
  
  Now, in principle you could simply attach these to relevant class-specific
  skills (mostly combat-related, in these cases.)  Or, you could have them
  derived from special equipment or guild-specific training.
  
  ...Make them learnable at the guild, but dependant on skill development.
  ...Alright.  That makes sense, at least in some cases.  But let's just
  pretend we're taking 8-9 skills as a base here.
  
  Start with these:
  Battle Tactics.  Close Combat.  Marksman.
  Piloting.  Stealth & Cover or Surveillance.  Halberd Gun.
