CURRENT ITEMS:


*  Implement a fast-forward/slow-down option.  (Plus save/load?)

*  Have an encyclopaedia listing of some kind.

   the harvest-quotient.

   from the map edges- or perhaps out as well.)

   Priority:  Medium-High  Duration:  Medium-High

   various mission-types.)

   Priority:  Medium-High  Duration:  Medium

*  Random-variation for offworld visit-intervals need to be reworked.
