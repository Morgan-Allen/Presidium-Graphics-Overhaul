   Priority:  Medium-High  Duration:  Medium-Long
*  Initial missions:
   Planitia Sector (robots + ruins, artifact.)
   Pavonis Sector (mild settlement, pacified.)
   Aeolis Sector (desert plus wildlife.)
   Marineris Sector (neutral + water/islands.  Some wildlife.)
   
   You'll need the ability to associate custom scenario-classes with various
   sectors (and possibly the ability to apply event-scripts within an existing
   scenario based on later outcomes.)

   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Short?
*  Patch up visual bugs and media assets in the new-game UI sequence.

   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Medium
*  Create a proper skin for the Airship model!

   Priority:  High  Duration:  Long to Very Long
*  Create and import Level-2 art-assets for the major guilds.

   Runner Market

   Physician Station
   Ecologist Station


   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Medium
*  Finally, colonisation of distant sectors also needs to be possible.  (This
   will require tearing down the old Stage/World and replacing it with a new
   one, when/if the player wants to start a new settlement.  That's an
   architectural change, and you may want to revamp Migration plans as well?)

   Priority:  High  Duration:  Long
*  Raids by roachmen are far too frequent- I think they need to follow the
   same pattern as either house-raids or wandering monsters.  Add some general
   'wandering monsters'.  And see if there are any common methods to factor
   out?
   
   Artilects.
   Vermin.
   Fauna.
   Natives.

   Priority:  High  Duration:  Long
*  You need to add resolution-effects for any available missions offworld- and
   to ensure that offworld-bases can select targets in-world effectively.
   
   Strike
   Recon
   Security
   Contact

   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Short?
*  This includes setting up trade-relations with distant sectors.  (This should
   just require some tweaks to the Pledge system.)

   Priority:  Medium  Duration:  Short
*  Offworld-missions will have to be screened, at minimum- and you should allow
   custom settings for mission-types available per mission.



   Priority:  Medium-Low  Duration:  Short?
*  Patch up terrain-FX for the excavation site.

   Priority:  Low  Duration:  Short
*  Restore the nursery at the ecologist station.
