NOTES ON SCENARIOS/STORY STRUCTURE:
  
  Action takes place on the planet of Diaspor.  20 sectors.  6 initially
  claimed.  2 as neutral ground (mostly deep oceans and rad zones.)  That
  leaves 12 sectors up for grabs with unique associated quests and production
  bonuses.
  
  (Place-names taken after Mars, modified dodecahedral projection.)
  
  
  Desert planet.  I don't want any tundra for the moment, just desert, swamps
  and deciduous forest.  That means oceans at the poles extending toward the
  equator to maintain thermostasis, but otherwise a single large land-mass.
  
  A = Ocean Verdi, extending into sectors 1 and 6 as a long island chain.
  B = Dolmen Sea, bordering on 7, 8 and 9.  (Large cliffs due to erosion,
  leaving pillars of harder rock staggering out in waves.  'Dolmens'.)
  
  The two seas don't intermix, but there's a relatively narrow isthmus running
  through sectors 2 and 7.  That's a fertile area, with grasslands sweeping
  along the north of sectors 5 and 6.
  
  Sectors 3 and 4 form a basin ringed by mountains that cut off moisture, and
  form an extremely arid environment- barrens and dunes.
  
  Sectors 0 and 9 were once settled, fertile, and dotted with the cities, but
  were left as irradiated ruins by the wars.  Today they are either barren or
  home to mutant tribes.

A:  Noachis Sector.   (The Ocean Verdi.)
    A 3-way skirmish is in progress between natives, smugglers and a renegade
    house.  Pacify them.

Aa: Pavonis Sector    (Altair start)
    Attract some nobles with personal estates to secure their loyalty in 60
    days.

0:  Boreum Sector.    (Desert & plains, highlands.)
    Mutant tribesmen survive from before the Mek Wars- secure access to their
    land resources.

0a: Vallis Sector.    (Suhail start)
    Terraform the desert wastes and produce a large food surplus in 60 days to
    prove your legitimacy.

0b: Arcadia Sector.   (Illegal settlement)
    A surface settlement is technically illegal- either incorporate, relocate
    or drive out the current inhabitants.

1:  Hellas Sector.    (The Archipelago.)
    Rescue or ransom some noble captives being held hostage by smugglers.

2:  Diacria Sector.   (Mountain isthmus with cloud forest.)
    Shaper tribes have banded to form stiff resistance but also hide a great
    relic.

3:  Aeolis Sector.    (Dune sea.)
    A company of symbionts is seeking a powerful Archon.

4:  Oxia Sector.      (Barren plateau, dunes.)
    A seemingly benign 'oracle' maintains an underground colony, but is also
    kidnapping settlers.  Either destroy or interrogate.


5:  Thaumasia Sector. (Savannah & grassland.)

6:  Planitia Sector.  (Marsh and jungle.)
    There are samples of a rare floral species to collect, but the area is
    guarded by territorial animals.

7:  Arabia Sector.    (Land isthmus with grassland.)
    The same native tribe from up north is threatened by a strange 'amoebic
    plague'.

8:  Coprates Sector.  (Ruins and irradiated barrens.)
    Ancient ruins are scattered on the surface with precious artifacts to be
    recovered.

8a: Elysium Sector.   (Procyon start)
    Armoured champions defend an imperial monastery.  Destroy or convert them
    within 60 days.

9b: Terra Sector.     (Massive obelisks.)
    Find a way to activate the old way-gate.  (Have to build up a large power
    surplus, repair uplinks and destroy guardians.)

9:  Marineris Sector. (Ocean cliffs, ruins, hills.)
    A lonely citadel is warded off by holographic defences.

9a: Olympus Sector    (Taygeta start)
    Smuggle out cached goods without being observed, and turn a tidy profit in
    60 days.


B:  Syrtis Sector.    (The Dolmen Sea.)
    Enormous sea creatures dominate the landscape, as a rich potential source
    of spyce.


Another 8 or so would be location-independent political objectives or events,
driven by procedural logic.

Another 8 or so would be knock-on effects of other events, with some
modification depending what side triggered them.

Another 4 would be end-game scenarios (or decisive events), each representing a
kind of 'existential threat' from the player's perspective-
  The AI Defence Matrix waking up (fatal to anyone beside House Procyon)
  The Republic eliminating feudalism (fatal to anyone beside House Altair)
  The Strains advancing human evolution (fatal to anyone beside House Ophiuchus)
  Destruction in war/vendetta (or by atomic exchange)

'Victory conditions'- the planet will be ceded to a particular house when all
rival forces have been driven out, forced into vassalhood (for a short time),
or allied with (for a longer period.)  You can continue to play on afterwards,
of course, either as a vassal, victor, or ally, gaining further mild prestige
or economic benefits.  Vassals and allies will, however, have more limited
demesnes.
